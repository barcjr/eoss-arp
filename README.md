This repository consists of the embedded firmware and software for BARC Jr.'s
second EOSS payload.

## Purpose
Conduct high-atmospheric research using the following sensors:

* Magnetometer (measure three-dimensional orientation)
* Temperature
* Pressure
* Humidity
* Ambient IR
* Ambient UV
* Ambient Light
* CO (carbon-monoxide)
* CO2 (carbon-dioxide)
* O3 (ozone)
* CH4 (methane)
* Alpha/Beta/Gamma Radiation
